WELCOME
----------

I consider myself a creative artist and then a photographer striving to create works of art. My passion is in creation…envisioning something in my mind then working at it till it becomes a reality. My artwork focuses on black and white photography with compositions containing architectural elements, abstracts of objects or places, and urban scenes. Since my first images I knew artistic photography was going to be a life long passion. Please head over to the About page to read more on that. My fine art prints are personally printed and matted, browse the Shop to find the perfect one for your space. If you are just here to look head over to the Portfolio. If you have a question, don’t be shy, send it my way via the Contact page. Thank you for stoping by…explore and enjoy!
