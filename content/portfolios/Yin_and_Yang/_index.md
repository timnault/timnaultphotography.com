{{< title title="Yin_and_Yang" description="In the Yin and Yang philosophy, opposite or contrary forces are actually complementary and interdependent. This is true of architecture and its connection with the surrounding cultures and environments. One influences the other in a balanced harmony. This portfolio explores the use of architectural elements in a Yin and Yang design." >}}
