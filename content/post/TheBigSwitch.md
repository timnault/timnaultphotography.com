For about 10+ year now I've used Wordpress for all my website needs. Wordpress is an amazing platform with an incredable community of support around it. Recently I have become frustrated with the cost of hosting and the overall complexity related to scaling the platform. Now obviously, I don't have Netflix level scalability needs, but I wanted to increase the spead of my site. 


I spent countless hours tweaking things to squeze every ounce of performance I could. I worked on tuning the data base, compressing images, and minifying code where I could. I implemented chaching both on the the server and the browser and used a Content distribution network. Don't get me wrong it was pretty darn fast. I was pleased, but it was a fairly complicated set up. I wanted simplicity.
