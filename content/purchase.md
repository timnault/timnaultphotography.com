I personally prepare, sign, and number all works. Prints are made using Piezography Special Edition inks. The images are printed on Canson Infinity Platine Fiber Rag Paper. This is a high quality 310 gsm paper with 100% cotton rag base. Mats are hand cut using museum quality mat board.

### **Editions, Printings, and Pricing** 

#### Editions
Signify the number of times the creative work has been redone. 1st edition means this is a print of the original creative work. As my technique and  technology advance the image may be reprocessed to improve its over all quality and representation of my creative vision. Each time this is done a new Edition will be released. With each new edition the number of printings starts over. 

#### Printing
This is the number of times an Edition has been printed. Printing are done in groups of 10 as follows:

* AP (Artist Print): prints 0-9
* 1st printing: prints 10-19
* 2nd printing: prints: 20-29
* 3rd, 4th, etc. 

Artist prints are generally not for sale and are prints created for my personal use. These short runs help me manage inventory and ensure that purchasers are getting the maximum amount of enjoyment out of their investment.  

#### Pricing
My goal for creating Editions and Printings is not to artificially inflate the pricing. it is a means of tracking the number of times a work as been reworked and printed. Initial pricing is based on my personal investment in the image as an artist and perceived market value. Prices may fluctuate based on the general economy and supply versus demand.
