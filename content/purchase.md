I personally prepare and sign all work. Prints are made using Piezography Special Edition inks. The images are printed on Canson Infinity Platine Fiber Rag Paper. This is a high quality 310 gsm paper with 100% cotton rag base. Mats are hand cut using museum quality mat board. 

If you’re interested in purchasing a print and/or would like to see a sample before proceeding, please us the contact form to send me a note.
